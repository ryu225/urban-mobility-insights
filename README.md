 Urban Mobility Insights – Riyadh Edition

Interactive dashboard to analyze commute times and traffic hotspots in Riyadh.
Built with Python + Streamlit, the project explores how traffic, cost, and carpooling/metro adoption scenarios affect daily mobility.

Problem
Riyadh residents face long commute times and rising transport costs.  
This project analyzes mobility data to highlight:
- Average commute times between districts  
- Peak congestion periods  
- What-if scenarios (e.g., +10% carpooling, metro expansion)

---

Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, requests)  
- Streamlit (dashboard UI)  
- Plotly / Folium (visualizations & heatmaps)

Goals
✅ Collect/simulate travel time data for Riyadh  
✅ Build an interactive dashboard  
✅ Generate consulting-style insights for Vision 2030 mobility plans
